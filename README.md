Objective: Create a temperature converter that accepts user input and converts to either Fahrenheit or Celsius.

1.	Add a text box that will accept any user input

2.	Prompt the user for a temperature.

3.	Structure your script into proper size functions.

a)	Each function should do a single task matching its name (action/verb).  

b)	Each function will have a Try-Catch block.  

c)	Subsequent functions will throw errors to the calling function.  Only the highest level function will display an error to the user if an exception is thrown.

4.	Have the user select from 2 radio buttons indicating which temperature conversion is desired (C->F or F->C).  For additional help with radio buttons, see https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_custom_radio 

5.	If the user enters incorrect information (i.e. text data) throw an exception.  Display the error in a user friendly manner using Bootstrap alerts (https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_js_alert.asp)  

6.	Place 2 buttons at the bottom of the page for “Try Again” and ”Exit”.
a.	If “Try Again” is clicked, clear all the input and output fields
b.	If “Exit” is clicked, display “Goodbye” and all elements fadeout(2000).

7.	Test your application by entering both numeric and text data to see how it responds


Please remember:
•	Use proper names for files and variables that would be meaningful to someone else having to modify your code.
•	Use proper spacing and indentation so blocks of code are easily recognizable.
